# OBCA: One Button to Control them All

Control meetings with a single button.

## Backstory:
I got bored in one of my many online classes. I realized that everyday I would sit in meetings where I would get yelled at to turn my camera on. As a result I wanted a fun way to control my online meetings.

## The build:
* Parts List:
    * Adafruit Feather 32u4
    * Rotory encoder
    * 3 LEDs
    * 4 Resistors
    * Big Ass button
With these materials I used the rotory encoder to select what I wanted to do. Turn the meeting off, toggle my camera, or toggle the microphone. THe LEDs are used to indicate what option is currently selected. Finally, the button is used to execute my command.

## The code:

Gonna be honest the code could be a lot cleaner but I wrote this while ignoring my online classes so give me a break.

## What's Next?

* Random command selector for those annoying classes.
* Some sort of display
* 3-D printed inclosure( Right now it's on a breadboard in a used disposable coffee cup)
* Added functionallity
    * Raise hand functionality
    * Right now it only works it the meeting spyware created by the company that is opposite of MegaHard.
